=======================================================

Plain Text is an amazingly simple file format.
No encoding, no under-lying formatting and hassle free.
The only problem has been the editors and not the format.
Plain Text editors have been too simple and feature lacking.
Now, all this can be different. Rich Text Format was a step forward, adding new features.
XPamphlet has a different approach, adding features to the editor instead of the format.
Small notetaking and documents can finally be as simple as they were meant to be.
